# Project 1 - Bike Sharing

Created the basic neural network using *numpy*. 
This is the solution to first project for the completion of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

Most of the code was already provided by Udacity themselves. All we had to do is to implement things in the *my_answers.py* file.

We were to initialize some hyper-parameters such as number of nodes in hidden layer, the learning rate, number of epochs. And to avoid over-fitting and uder-fitting.
